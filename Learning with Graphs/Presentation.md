## Status
- We are able to run the scripts provided in the official repository, even though the library versions do not match exactly (torch 2.0.1+cu117 instead of torch 1.9.0+cu102, python 3.8.17 instead of 3.6.8)
- Due to the (very) slow transfer speeds from the Stanford OGB dataset library, we will have to look for alternative sources for the datasets.
- Even if we do find alternative sources, however, we will work only with the ogb-arxiv, ogb-protein and ogb-products datasets (79MB, 215MB, and 1.4GB respectively), since the size of the ogb-papers100 dataset is very large (56GB).
